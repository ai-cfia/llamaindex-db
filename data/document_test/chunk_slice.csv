Enteritidis In order to maintain export eligibility, flocks that are subject to Pullorum testing under section 79.17 of the Health of Animals Regulations and who have been vaccinated against S. Enteritidis using a killed vaccine must implement the following procedures immediately: Monthly environmental sampling by an accredited veterinarian consisting of 4 drag swabs per house and 2 nest/egg belt samples per house (if flock is in lay) Samples are submitted by the accredited veterinarian to a provincial diagnostic laboratory currently performing testing on behalf of the CFIA Hatchery Program for full bacterial culture using the CFIA harmonized culture method for paratyphoid salmonella that has recently been finalized. The operator must take the appropriate arrangements with the provincial laboratory to have all laboratory results returned to the district office supervising the operation. Monthly environmental sampling is to continue for the life of the flock. A positive finding for S. Pullorum, S. Gallinarum, S. Enteritidis, or S. Typhimurim (including the variant Typhimurium) renders the flock ineligible for export. When a new flock is placed: Place 350 marked sentinel birds within each flock if SE vaccination is practiced. Vaccinate the balance of the flock with the killed vaccine as per the label. Commence environmental sampling (4 drag swabs per house) at 2-4 weeks of age and continue on a monthly basis. When the flock enters the lay period 2 nest/egg belt samples per house must be taken in addition to the 4 drag swabs. This monthly sampling continues for the life of the flock. Test 315 sentinel birds at 4 months of age with Pullorum antigen using either the Tube Agglutination Test (TAT) or the stained antigen rapid whole blood test. In the case of a positive or inconclusive test reaction, send up to 25 birds to the authorized laboratory for sacrifice and organ culture.

Fully processed cooked means that materials must be: Cooked and dry (""crunchy"") (kibble type products produced through an extrusion process); or Semi-moist products produced through an extrusion process or Hermetically sealed products (packaged using a retort process).

25,23076e72-924c-4922-a48c-6b365318b273,"Summary The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Trusted Trader Customs Self Assessment (CSA) Program facilitates the movement of goods from the United States and Mexico across the Canadian border for trusted businesses, streamlining many of the border requirements so that low-risk shipments can be processed more quickly and efficiently when they enter Canada. This saves businesses time and money, and allows the CBSA to better focus its resources on identifying higher risk shipments that pose a potential threat to the health, safety or economic well-being of Canadians. Under the CSA Program, products with other government department requirements, such as food, are not eligible for clearance. As part of the 2011 Canada-United States Beyond the Border Action Plan, the CBSA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) carried out an 18-month pilot project with a major food importing company to test the feasibility of allowing the importation of selected low-risk processed, prepackaged foods from the United States into Canada under the CSA Program, while continuing to meet or exceed CFIA food safety objectives. The project assessed the effectiveness of established and modified processes, standards and channels of communication aimed at ensuring compliance with CFIA and CBSA rules and regulations. The agencies and importing company also conducted food safety exercises that simulated how the parties would respond to a food safety incident involving foods imported through the program. Overall, the pilot was useful in identifying key considerations and issues, such as administrative, process and resource requirements, which would need to be addressed if the CSA Program were to be adopted for processed foods on a broader scale. Specifically, it determined that import transaction data can be received after foods are imported into Canada, provided the importer has the necessary processes in place to respond to, manage and mitigate risks in the event of a food safety incident. Under the current commercial import process, importers are required to submit transaction data prior to entry. Over the course of the pilot gaps were identified in the exchange of information between CBSA, CFIA and the importer as they related to party notification and food traceability. The processes put in place by the CBSA and CFIA to address these gaps were effective, but resource intensive. Despite these challenges, the importer was able to benefit from expedited border clearance. The two Agencies have agreed to further evaluate whether other food importers would be able to participate successfully in the CSA Program while ensuring compliance with Government of Canada requirements."

27,8dbd3adf-7abd-45ef-97cf-73c92f425368,"Background Initiated in 2001, the CBSA CSA Program is an established mechanism for approved commercial clients to clear low-risk shipments (historically non-food products) originating from the United States and/or Mexico in an expedited fashion. The Program is designed for low-risk, pre-approved importers, carriers and registered drivers. To participate, the importers, carriers and drivers must undergo a risk assessment, and importers must demonstrate that they have systems and processes in place to meet reporting requirements, including providing detailed product descriptions upon request. Benefits for importers include a simplified accounting and payment process for all imported goods and expedited reporting at the border. The standard commercial import process of food products requires importers to submit pre-entry transaction data to obtain CFIA approvals. Unlike the standard commercial import process, the CSA Program does not require importers to submit pre-entry transaction data. Due to the differences in the submission of transaction data, food products have historically not been allowed on the CSA Program. Seeking to maximize the Program's effectiveness and facilitate trade across the Canada-United States border, the two Agencies committed to a one-year pilot project to test the Program in the processed foods sector as part of the Canada-United States Beyond the Border Action Plan. The pilot was limited to a large, fully integrated importer and a limited selection of food products (e.g. cake mix, spices, confectionary) originating from the United States."

29,0c342a79-fdf0-4474-97af-be069bd19f39,"Objectives The objectives of the pilot were to: test the feasibility of allowing the importation of processed, prepackaged foods from the United States into Canada under the CSA Program while continuing to meet or exceed CFIA food safety objectives; and develop and examine CSA Program modifications where deemed necessary for product tracking and traceability purposes, such as in transactional data reporting and communications.
Methodology The pilot was a collaborative project involving the CBSA, the CFIA and a large, fully integrated food company. For the purposes of the pilot, the CSA Program was adapted to include clearance of selected regulated low-risk food products. The participants undertook to enter into an agreement defining the conditions of the pilot and requiring that the importer submit import transaction data after entering the country. During the pilot the participants explored whether the importer could properly clear a limited selection of low-risk foods from the United States through Canadian customs using the CSA process. Participants also undertook a tabletop exercise to examine the communication and response implications of the CSA Program for the CFIA and its partners in a mock food safety incident scenario. The scenario was an important component of testing the importer's ability to trace and control food products in the event of a food safety incident. The following criteria were assessed during the CSA pilot: the timeliness with which the importer could submit transaction and product data to the CFIA after the shipments were imported into Canada; the effectiveness with which the participants could mitigate communication gaps and respond to food safety incidents involving the products being imported; and the ability of the importer to comply with the CSA Program modifications imposed during the food CSA pilot."

34,4e9509d2-af00-49e5-8c21-a480f555709f,"Results and Key Findings The pilot confirmed a significant gap in how information, such as import transaction data containing detailed product descriptions, was exchanged, thereby affecting the CFIA's ability to effectively identify and track foods imported into Canada. To address this gap, the importer was able to provide import transaction data electronically to the CFIA in a timely manner after food products were imported into Canada. Introducing import restrictions in the event of a food safety incident proved challenging in a CSA environment. To address this challenge, participants successfully tested a protocol to identify and control food products in the event of a food safety incident, thereby confirming the ability of the CFIA and its partners' ability to continue to effectively respond and communicate during food safety incidents. However, this protocol relied heavily on a chain of person-to-person communications that was resource intensive and introduced the risk of human error. The exercises revealed that the importer had processes in place to respond to, manage and mitigate food safety risks. The importer's processes and advanced IT systems proved to be effective during mock food safety incidents conducted through simulation exercises. Participation in the CSA Program resulted in benefits for the participating importer, in part because the importer was able to address the CSA Program modifications during the pilot. As a participant in the pilot, the importer reaped the benefits of expedited border clearance. All of the importer's CSA shipments were subjected to the same level of scrutiny as non-CSA shipments by the CBSA at the border. The importer was able and willing to address the CSA Program modifications introduced as part of the pilot."

The additional processes put in place by the CBSA and the CFIA during the pilot to address gaps related to information exchange, notification, and traceability were effective but resource-intensive, largely because they depended on a manual, person-to-person communication process. Additionally, the pilot determined that the importer had advanced systems in place in order to manage import processes under CSA and to respond to, mitigate and manage risks in the event of a food safety incident."

49,eb673a65-13fe-46df-a95f-625d1a7960e5,"Adventitious Presence of Soy in Grain Products February 12, 2013, Ottawa: The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada are advising manufacturers and importers of grain-based products that precautionary labelling for soy is not required on these products when a low level of soy is present due to adventitious presence
 Health risk assessments have determined that the low levels of soy due to adventitious presence would not be expected to cause an allergic reaction in the soy allergic community
 Since 2009-2010, the CFIA has been conducting targeted surveys for undeclared allergens aimed at evaluating various foods for specific hazards
 The main objective of these surveys is to obtain baseline information regarding the presence and levels of possible undeclared allergens, including soy, in grain-based products
 Results of the surveys for soy have demonstrated the low level presence of soy in some grain-based foods
 Based on the low levels of soy that have been detected, Health Canada has determined that exposure is not likely to represent a health risk for soy allergic individuals
 The adventitious presence of soy in cereal grains can occur due to the manner by which soy and other grains, such as wheat, are grown, harvested, stored and transported
 This adventitious presence is not unique to soy, but can occur with other cereal grains and is reflected in the current grain grading standards for quality

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is proposing new regulations to improve oversight of imported food products in the Non-Federally Registered Sector (NFRS). This regulatory proposal would: Strengthen the accountability of food importers for the safety of their products; Allow the CFIA to better identify and engage importers; and Improve importers' ability to quickly identify, respond to and advise the CFIA of potentially unsafe imported food. The proposed regulations will apply to imported food products that are not already regulated under commodity-specific regulations under the Canada Agricultural Products Act. Examples of such products include, but are not limited to: Bakery products Confectionery/chocolate Grains, breads and cereals Juices Snack foods Beverages Coffee and tea Fats and oils Infant formula Meal replacements and formulated liquid diets Spices and seasonings Under the proposal, importers would need to have a licence. To obtain a licence, importers would need to develop, implement and maintain a written Preventive Food Safety Control Plan outlining the actions and measures taken to keep their food safe and compliant with Canadian regulations.

The revised assessment tolerances as described below will come into effect April 1, 2012.
Background: The standard for flour as stated in the Food and Drug Regulations (FDR) [B.13.001] requires the mandatory addition of five nutrients (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid and iron) and allows for optional addition of four nutrients (vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, magnesium and calcium) at set levels per 100g of flour. In early 2010, the CNMA presented research findings to Health Canada’s Food Directorate which demonstrated that the fortification levels for enriched flour as they are currently prescribed in B.13.001 of the FDR, cannot consistently be achieved by Canadian millers through current industry fortification practices. In response to these findings, it was agreed that the tolerance utilized by the Agency to assess the compliance of flour samples should be increased.
Decision: Health Canada has confirmed that a tolerance of no less than 80% and no more than 175% of all nutrient values currently specified in the flour standard would be acceptable when assessing enriched flour samples. Health Canada has determined that these fortification values will not pose a risk to the Canadian consumer, will meet the policy intent for the fortification of food, will comply with applicable health and safety requirements and will be consistently achievable based on current industry practices. However, it should be noted that this decision is subject to reassessment and adjustment as deemed necessary by Health Canada, or as advances in nutritional food safety and milling practices become available."

Ottawa, January, 29, 2016: The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is reminding importers that fresh fruit and vegetables intended to be consumed raw and that are treated with sulphites are not permitted for sale in Canada. Only grapes are exempt from this restriction. Sulphites are sulphur-based substances that may be used by suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables as preservatives to prevent product spoilage and discoloration during storage and transport. The presence of sulphites in fresh fruit and vegetables may present a serious or life threatening health risk for sensitive individuals. More information for people sensitive to sulphites is available on the Health Canada website. All food offered for sale in Canada, whether domestic or imported, must comply with the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations and the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and Regulations. To ensure compliance, Canadian importers are encouraged to: communicate to foreign suppliers that fresh fruit and vegetables entering Canada must meet regulatory requirements, including those for safety; implement processes to verify that their suppliers have and can provide documentation to demonstrate that fresh fruit and vegetables are compliant with the Canadian food safety requirements; verify the absence of sulphites (for example, by means of a letter of guarantee or certificate of analysis); source fresh fruit and vegetables from foreign suppliers who do not use sulphites. The CFIA continues to monitor the presence of sulphites on fresh fruit and vegetables intended to be consumed raw. When the CFIA finds cases of non-compliance, the Agency may conduct additional inspections, test incoming lots, and detain/seize and/or recall the product. The CFIA will also inform the competent authority in the exporting country when non-compliance is identified. For more information, please refer to the CFIA Fresh Fruit and Vegetables web pages.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem A variety of pathogenic organisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7), Salmonella spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. have been known to cause human illness related to the consumption of juice/cider. E. coli O157:H7 is the most frequently isolated of these strains which are referred to as Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli.
1.2 Possible Causes of Contamination The most likely cause of the contamination is fruit coming in contact with animal faeces, or water, workers, containers or processing equipment contaminated with animal faeces. Cattle, deer and sheep, are the most common reservoirs for the pathogen, but usually do not show symptoms themselves. Birds, rodents, insects and poor hygiene may also contribute to the contamination. Traditionally, unpasteurized juice or cider has been considered non hazardous because of its high acidity. However, recent data from research indicates that pathogenic organisms such as E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. can survive in acid foods including apple cider up to four weeks even though it is refrigerated. In addition, the number of bacteria required to cause illness is very low. One contaminated piece of fruit could affect an entire batch of juice or cider. The practice of washing fresh apples before pressing has recently been found ineffective at eliminating pathogen. Adding preservatives is also not considered a consistent and reliable means of killing pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7."
56,db73f970-551c-46ba-8d22-9166b614d781,"1.3 Reducing the Risk Adults and children having contact with potential animal carriers should be made aware of the extremely low infective dose of E. coli O157:H7 and the potential for its transmission from such contact to maturing fruit Despite the best efforts, organisms like E. coli may survive and be found in the final product. Microbial monitoring is not considered an effective means of detecting contaminated products since the levels are likely to be low. Therefore, until more is known about how unpasteurized juices and ciders become contaminated, manufacturers should take steps to reduce the risk of contamination by following the Code of Practice. Steps to reduce the risk should include the close inspection of tree-picked fruit, decontamination processing procedures and labelling the product ""Unpasteurized"". The young, the elderly and those in poor health are considered to be at higher risk. The development of a HACCP (see definitions) plan for juice/cider processing operations is an excellent way to control the process and minimize safety hazards.
2 Scope The objective of this Code of Practice is to define ""Good Agricultural and Manufacturing Practices"" to promote the production and sale in Canada of unpasteurized fruit juice/cider that is safe and of the highest quality. It sets out recommendations for growing, harvesting, transporting, storing, processing, packaging and distributing. Its aim is preventing the contamination of juice/cider by pathogenic microorganisms such as E. coli O157:H7. The Code was developed to address the production and distribution of safe unpasteurized juices/ciders but was not intended to instruct consumers on how to handle the product. The Code of Practice is concerned with matters which may affect the levels of occurrence and/or introduction of pathogens during production and distribution of unpasteurized fruit juice/cider. None of the recommendations and guidelines of the Code of Practice can guarantee pathogen free juice/cider. However, their implementation will serve to reduce the possibility that the juice/cider will be contaminated. The Code of Practice is based on existing knowledge of factors which influence contamination of unpasteurized fruit juice/cider. This Code of Practice was initiated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada (HC) and developed in partnership with the provinces, the industry and the Consumers Association of Canada. The Code of Practice has drawn on experience from industry (Canadian and international) and will be revised as new information from research institutions, industry, and government experts becomes available."

4.1 Orchard Management Foodborne pathogens can be introduced into orchards via animal waste (domestic and/or wild). As much as possible, a means of excluding domestic and wild animals should be used (i.e. fencing). Where bird roosting is a problem, a means should be used to scare and prevent birds from roosting and soiling the fruit. To reduce the risk, neither animal manure nor human waste should be used. Research on pathogen survival in manure treatments and on assessing the risk of cross-contamination of food crops from manure under varying conditions is largely just beginning. Composting and other treatments may reduce but may not eliminate pathogens in manure. Water used to dilute pesticides and irrigate orchards should be of an acceptable microbiological quality. This water can be a source of microbiological contamination, therefore growers should be aware of conditions that make the water source more susceptible to microbiological contaminants and follow control practices to ensure that water quality is sufficient for its intended use. The grower should maintain records of pesticide and fertilizer applications (chemical and date).
4.2 Harvesting Practices Sound ripe fruit should be picked and placed into clean bins suitable for transportation directly to a storage facility, sorting station or juice/cider plant, as appropriate. Adequate training and supervision should be provided to ensure fruit is undamaged. Pickers must be free from communicable diseases (diseases which can be passed onto humans) and trained to practise personal hygiene and sanitation, and must also be provided with adequate washroom facilities including a means to wash and dry hands. Employees having boils, open cuts or wounds must not handle food or food contact surfaces unless the injury is completely protected by a secure waterproof covering (e.g., rubber gloves). DROP FRUIT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR UNPASTEURIZED JUICE/CIDER. Diseased, rotten fruit, fruit with damaged skin (with flesh exposed) and fruit with dirt or animal/bird excrement should be rejected. Rotten fruit should be removed before storage since some moulds produce patulin (toxic metabolite); wholesome fruit for pressing should be kept in clean, dry bins. Runners on full fruit bins should be inspected and cleaned before stacking. Fruit bins should be labelled or coded to show orchard location, picking date and picking crew. Records should be kept.
5 Intermediate Operations"
65,073dfa8f-3d13-447d-b1b5-c3f14e8ac28c,"5.1 Transportation Practices All potential sources of fecal contamination of bins and fruit must be minimized during handling and transport. Workers handling fruit should practise good hygiene and vehicles used for transportation should be clean. Care should also be taken to avoid physical damage to the fruit.
5.2 Fruit Storage Practices Ideally, fruit should be pressed as soon as possible after picking to avoid increases of pH that would favor growth of pathogens during storage. The lower the pH, the worse the conditions will be for the growth and survival of pathogens. However, if fruit needs to be stored, rapid cooling to as close to 0ºC as possible (0 to 4ºC) and achievement of adequate storage conditions will maintain fruit condition. Storage facilities must be clean, secure from rodents and insects and suitable for storing food. Each storage facility should be fitted with a temperature measuring or a temperature recording device. Records of storage temperature should be kept. Fruit should be handled as gently as possible; every effort should be made to minimize physical damage at all stages of post-harvest handling prior to pressing. After removal from cold storage, fruit should be pressed as soon as possible.
5.3 Fruit Sorting Fruit should be inspected in a clean, dry, well-lit environment by workers who have been trained in inspection and personal hygiene. Only sound whole fruit should be used. Decayed, wormy, damaged (with flesh exposed), soiled (excrement) fruit should be culled to prevent contamination of juice/cider. Fruit sorting should be carried out dry to prevent such culls, as above, from spreading contamination. All lubricants and surfaces coming into contact with foods should be made of food grade materials."

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) monitors and verifies that food products meet Canadian standards and regulations. This proactive approach includes monitoring, inspection, sampling and testing activities. The inspection of fresh fruit and vegetable packers, re-packers and fresh-cut operators of fresh produce verifies that potential health risks related to the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables are minimized. These inspections focus on: industry's implementation of good manufacturing practices, good handling practices, and preventive food safety controls; label verification; and microbiological and chemical residue sampling and testing programs The inspections apply to fresh fruit and vegetables, whether exported, imported or traded interprovincially, such as berries, fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, green onions, herbs, leafy green vegetables, melons, peppers, raw nuts and tomatoes. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Regulations, pursuant to the Canada Agricultural Products Act, and the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations provide the CFIA with the authority to undertake these inspections. In addition, the inspections will verify whether fresh-cut operators have implemented Health Canada's Policy on Listeria monocytogenes in Ready-to-Eat Foods (2011) in fresh-cut operations. Non-Compliance When non-compliance is found or a situation poses a health risk to Canadian consumers, the CFIA takes appropriate action. These actions may include notifying the regulated party of the problem, a request for corrective actions, additional follow-up inspections, further directed sampling, or product detention/seizure and/or recall. In cases where corrective actions are requested, follow-up inspections are conducted to verify that corrections have been implemented as planned. The inspection of fresh fruit and vegetable packers, re-packers and fresh-cut operators supports the shared responsibility that government, industry and consumers have for food safety and prevention of illnesses associated with fresh produce.

Inc.) was convicted of one count of contravening subsection 30.1(2) of the Meat Inspection Regulations, 1990, and one count of contravening subsection 94(7) of the Meat Inspection Regulations, 1990, as well as three counts of contravening subsection 14(1) of the Meat Inspection Act and was ordered to pay a $21,000 fine. Subsection 30.1(2) of the Meat Inspection Regulations refers to the registered establishment operator's obligation to keep records of its food safety control programs and procedures. Subsection 94(7) of the Meat Inspection Regulations indicates that the labels of meat products should not be false or misleading. Subsection 14(1) of the Meat Inspection Act prevents anyone from making a false or misleading statement to an inspector. The CFIA's investigation determined that Mr. Plourde had directed, authorized, consented to or participated in the alteration of computer data relating to product traceability, used labels conveying false or misleading information concerning the date of production of meat products, and made false statements on export certificates. The CFIA is responsible for the administration and enforcement of federal acts and regulations, including the Meat Inspection Act and its Regulations.

75,001fef49-eba7-418d-88fa-22ab1ad21e9e,"5.4 Fruit Cleaning All fruit should be subjected to effective washing, brushing and rinsing. Included in the washing may be a food grade sanitizer found in the ""Reference Listing of Accepted Construction Materials, Packaging Materials and Non-Food Chemicals"" published by the CFIA. Sanitizers should be rinsed from the fruit unless otherwise instructed by the manufacturer's directions. Sanitizer levels should be monitored at appropriate intervals and recorded. Water supplies for fruit cleaning must be potable according to the ""Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality"" published by HC and any applicable provincial requirements. Municipal water supplies should be checked for microbiological quality twice per year. Well water should be checked for microbiological quality at the start of the season and at least once per month during the processing season by a qualified laboratory. Records of potable water quality checks should be kept. Flume, wash and rinse water should not be recycled. Wash water should be at least 5ºC warmer than the fruit to be pressed otherwise, microbial contaminants present in the wash water could be drawn into the flesh or core of the fruit.
6 Processing Facilities and Operations
6.1 Premises The juice/cider processing facility must be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before seasonal start-up. The sanitation must be maintained during the processing season according to a written sanitation program. Records should be kept. Animals (domestic and pests) must be excluded from the processing facility and surrounding area. The processing facility must be adequately screened to eliminate insect and rodent entry. A written pest control program should be followed and the results recorded. Floors should be smooth, non porous, impervious to water and properly drained. Walls, doors and ceilings should be smooth, non-porous, non-chipping and impervious to water. Doors should be close fitting, and self closing where appropriate. Lighting in the pressing and filling areas should be adequate. Light bulbs and fixtures should be protected to prevent contamination of the juice/cider in case of breakage. The sewage system and garbage storage/removal must meet all of the requirements of the local regulatory authorities having jurisdiction."
